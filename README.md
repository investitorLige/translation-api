# Legal Translator REST API

A simple FastAPI REST API that serves the English â†’ Serbian legal document translator model.
This service exposes endpoints for translation so the model can be integrated into other applications.

Port forwarded with ngrok to test but currently only defined so it can run localy 

It is designed in mind to integrate my trained pytorch model with the flutter front. Currently as is in the code, its just fetching
a trained huggingface translation model
